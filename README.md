# Unity-UI-Toolkit-Runtime-Tests

This is a personal repository to test the new unity ui toolkit. 
Maybe someone else can find something useful in it. 
Feel free to contribute to it and to use it.  

### Example 1: Native Menubar
I try to recreate a native menubar with the toolkit. You can find all the files in Assets/NativeMenubar. Still WIP.
